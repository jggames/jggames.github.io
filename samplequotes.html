<h2>Citation in Your Paper:</h2>

<p>In writings in the Arts and Humanities the meaning of sentences can often hinge on the
subtle details of expression. Therefore, as Jim Gerrie states, "one of the best
ways to include the ideas of others in a philosophy or religious studies paper is by quoting their words directly and referencing them appropriately" (Gerrie 2009, 40).&nbsp;  Never include references from materials for which you cannot supply at least an author (or organizational "author"), title and date of publication.  For electronic sources the date of publication is <b>not</b> equivalent to the date that you access the information, but must refer to a date included in the accessed material that indicates when it was posted or last updated.  Similarly, electronic documents must have titles internal to the document itself. A web address (URL) is not acceptable as a title. The following examples are based on the Author-Date system outlined by the <i>The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition</i> as presented by the <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/12/">Owl Purdue On-line Writing Lab</a>.</p>
