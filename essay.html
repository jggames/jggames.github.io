<h1 align="center">Writing a Good Essay</h1>
<hr>

<p>I use the following scheme to mark essay assignments. It describes the basic components that you should include in your essay:</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Your position on the issue:</td><td>/2     (POS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Argument(s) for your position:</td><td>/3     (ARG)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Objection(s) to your argument(s):</td><td>/3     (OBJ)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response(s) to the objection(s):</td><td>/2     (RES)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Writing, grammar and style:</td><td>/2      (WRIT)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Participation in class discussion</td><td>/3      (ORAL, if assigned)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total:</td><td>/15 or 12 (See Course Outline for actual weight)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Defending a position crafted in consideration of what a thoughtful opponent might say is the core of good essay writing. Such objections can be drawn from research into the contending positions on an issue, such as you might uncover in a <a href="researchpaper.html">research paper assignment</a>), your imagination, or conversations with others.</p>

<p>Start your essay by working out a preliminary position. Any research should focus on finding support for this position (relevant facts or supporting arguments from authorities, etc).  When you have an argument or two worked out, use these specfic arguments as guides for subsequent research into possible thoughtful objections (like the objections you might raise in a <a href="critique.html">critique assignment</a>). If you can respond to those objections then you are done. If you can't, then either modify your conclusion or the reasons you have for drawing your conclusion ("premises") until you have an argument that can stand-up to thoughtful opposition. Your final essay should include only your best argument(s) for your position, the most thoughtful objection(s) and your response(s).</p>

<p>When it comes to the ORAL component, I don't expect you to come to class with graphs, laser pointers, or any paraphernalia whatsoever.  What I do expect is that you will come prepared to discuss the topic assigned for that day, which is also the topic of your essay. You should at least be able to describe your position and a main argument for it or a possible objection that you have considered. However, simply engaging with others by responding to their points, or raising a good question or two about what they have said, are equally good ways to achieve a good mark in this component.</p>
