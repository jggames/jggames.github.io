<h1 align="center">Preparing a Bibliography Assignment</h1>
<hr>

<p>A bibliography assignment is a way of
preparing for writing a research paper, essay or critique paper. You must find
and document <u>two</u> possible relevant scholarly sources that address the
question of the assignment.  Such sources can be articles in reputable journals,
chapters or sections in books, or other relevant materials containing authoritative
arguments relevant to the topic.  In keeping with the spirit of the methods of
Socrates, you should find sources who both agree and disagree with your own
views.</p>

<p>Answer the following 6 questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>What style format are you using to present your sources (e.g. MLA, APA,
Chicago Manual of Style, etc.)?</li>

<li>What is your preliminary position on the topic
question?</li>

<li>What is the bibliographical reference of your
first source: </li>

<li>What is the bibliographical reference of your second
source:</li>

<li>Which source is closest to your own tentative
position on the topic question (i.e. identify the main conclusion of the author
and how it might be relevant to your position)?</li>

<li>Which source is farthest from your own tentative position on the
topic question (i.e. identify the main conclusion of the author and how it
might be relevant to your position)?</li>

</ol>

<p>Your responses to questions 1-4 should only be a sentence in length. Write only a paragraph in response to questions 5 and 6.</p>

<p>You do not have to take the same position in your paper for which you are preparing. You do not have to use the sources you identify 
here in your final paper. If you find better sources as you complete your paper, feel free to change to those sources.</p>
